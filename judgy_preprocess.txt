{"transcription": " This is Yajat, this is Darnoosh, this is Vibha. We love taking part in hackathons, but every time we hit the Submit Project button, we all have wondered how do judges evaluate hundreds of projects in a given time frame that God is thinking. Hackathons are getting popular day by day, but hackathon judging still remains a human intensive task. Combine that with the sheer amount of submissions and the time constraint that definitely leads to some missed, high potential ideas, limited market knowledge about these ideas and lack of understanding or sometimes even evaluating the code of the hackathon project. We hear you judges, that's why we have created a platform to help you with those long complex hours of judging. Introducing Jaji, your trusted ally for hackathon judging. Jaji streamlines the hackathon judging process by providing AI generated market research and code analysis for every project. Judges can start off by configuring the hackathon. They can set the theme of the hackathon, for example, healthcare, open-ended, fintech and agri-tech and add if there are any technologies that must be used in the project. For example, Vertex AI. Jaji understands and evaluates projects based on these parameters. Now let's load a hackathon project called Speechinator that uses AI to analyze user speech and help them practice their speech. Here we're filling in the project title, description and project links. Once submitted, Jaji deploys two agents. One to conduct market research, another one to conduct code analysis on the idea submitted. After a while, the results are updated in the submission detail page. The market agent analyzes the target audience, the potential, market size, the pitfalls and existing products in the market related to the submission idea. What is really cool about this agent is the fact that it uses Vertex AI's palm model under the hood that has capabilities to fetch data from the internet. The code agent analyzes the GitHub repository and gives details about code quality, technologies used and checks if the project uses all the required tech provided while configuring the hackathon. The chat with Jaji section helps the judges ask questions about the submissions as well as the code base. It uses LangChain to integrate multiple AI agents in the background. Now that enables us to ask questions about anything related to the submission idea. For example, we asked Jaji which age group would benefit from Speechinator. It responded correctly stating that all age groups would benefit, especially those who want to practice speech. We also asked Jaji how speech is analyzed in the code repository submitted. It responded correctly stating that the underlying project uses a Pratt script to analyze the speech which is indeed the case. Jaji makes it a breeze to load multiple projects at once by uploading a CSV with all the hackathon details. Jaji also has a semantic search feature that helps judges search for projects with context. For example, here we searched for all health related projects. The platform is able to give out the top 10 closest match. The possibilities with Jaji are limitless and it truly has the potential to revolutionize the hackathon industry. That's about it.
