[{"featureName": "How is the Market Research Agent implemented in code?", "implementationStatus": "Implemented", "explanation": "The implementation of the Market Research Agent is done using the FastAPI framework in Python. The agent is defined as a separate router in the main server file. It uses the langchain library to initialize the agent and perform market research tasks. The agent makes use of tools like DuckDuckGoSearchRun and VertexAI for searching and analyzing data. It also interacts with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve project information. The agent is invoked asynchronously using asyncio and the results are returned as a response."}, {"featureName": "Explain the implementation of the Code Reviewer Agent", "implementationStatus": "Implemented", "explanation": "The Code Reviewer Agent is implemented as a function called `invoke_code_agent`. It takes two parameters: `repolink` and `project_id`. First, it clones the repository from the given `repolink` to a local directory specified by `DIRECTORY`. Then, it retrieves the branch of the repository and creates a `GitLoader` object with the repository path and branch. Next, it initializes a `ChatVertexAI` object and creates a `VectorstoreIndexCreator` object. The `VectorstoreIndexCreator` is used to create an index from the `GitLoader` object. Then, it retrieves the technologies from the `hackathons` collection in the MongoDB database. It loops through the documents in the collection and assigns the value of the `technologies` field to the `technologies` variable. After that, it defines a prompt string that will be used to ask questions to the code reviewer. The prompt includes the question to be asked and some rules for answering. The code then iterates through a list of predefined questions and queries the index with each question using the `query` method. The responses from the index are stored in a list called `agentAnswers`. Finally, the code saves the answers to the database by creating a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the question and its corresponding answer. The `update_one` method is used to update the document in the `projects` collection with the new values. The function ends by printing \"Code Agent : Task Complete\" to indicate that the task is finished."}, {"featureName": "How is the chatbot implemented in the codebase?", "implementationStatus": "Implemented", "explanation": "The chatbot implementation in the codebase can be found in the /chat-agent endpoint. The chatAgent_endpoint function handles the GET request for the chat agent, while the invoke_chat_agent function handles the POST request. The invoke_chat_agent function retrieves data from the request, performs some database queries, and saves context in the memory. It then uses the ChatVertexAI model to generate a response based on the input question."}, {"featureName": "Explain the implementation of the semantic search feature powered by AI", "implementationStatus": "Not Implemented", "explanation": "I don't know the answer to this question."}]
